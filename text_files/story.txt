An older lady hears the crying of a baby out in the distance as she's relaxing on her couch.
This is very strange considering she lives out in the middle of the country miles from a small village.
The small baby is found covered in dirt and mud outside her shed.
She warms him up and gives him a bath.
She discovers markings on his chest that she is unable to recognize.
The old lady calls the Shaman who examines the baby.
He trembles as he grazes his hand across the symbols with an expression of disbelief.
These symbols died off with the evolution of civilization and the growing distance between spirituality and our flesh.
This shocks the Shaman and the old lady.
"7 years later..."
The lady is surrounded at cliffs edge by a mountain lion.
The boy sprints over just as the lady was about to fall off the edge of a cliff trying to get away.
He grabs her and brings her to safety.
The old lady passes out to be awakened by the boy carrying her in one arm and the dead cougar in the other, she screams.
Something is not right and life as they knew it would never be the same again.
The boy begins to train and become a stronger fighter to protect his family from predators and eventually his community from evil men.
The boy is now an adolescent man who is now being asked to fight a bully who is threatening to take over his country.
You must choose how he will prepare for this fight.
